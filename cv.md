3. Hi all! My name is Sergey, I am 41 years old. I am from Dnepropetrovsk, Ukraine. In my life I am mainly a builder (carpenter, electrician, welder, etc.). A couple of years ago I started to get interested in the frontend. Learned to type a little, studied JS. But due to the lack of any system, he constantly scored ... then forgot ... and again on a new one. In general, I decided to try my hand at this course. I hope it will be possible to overcome this “barrier” and start doing something concrete. Plus the opportunity to join the community. All success and good luck!! Good and Peace!!
